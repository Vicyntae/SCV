# SCV
Skyrim Capacity Vore
Addon for SCL which adds oral and anal vore to Skyrim

## Requirements
 * SCL and its requirements
 
#### Recommended:

* New belly scaling method included in SCL! Only requires Racemenu/NetImmerse!
* New animations also included! Install with FNIS!
* Includes compatibility with Size Matters: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/87576/ Requires that the option is active in the MCM menu, the intro quest for Size Matters is completed, and you have the Nourishment perk.
##### Skeletal Belly Scaling
* If you want belly scaling, you need a skeleton that supports this. I recommend XPMSE http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68000/?
* Scaling and inflation also needs Racemenu/NetImmerse http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/?
* And a body to support it. I recommend CBBE or UNP for females http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666/? and SAM w/ HDT for males https://www.vectorplexus.com/
 * Make sure you build CBBE/UNP with BodySlide to enable inflation (tutorials coming soon)
* If you're hip to it, also includes out-the-box compatibility with SLIF http://www.loverslab.com/topic/53219-sexlab-inflation-framework/
 
### Wishlist
 * Burping sound effect
 * Vomiting sound effect
 * Eating animations (and (new) sounds)
 * (New) Belly Meshes
 * ~~Suggestions for perk requirements~~
 * Walking animations
 * Groaning sound effects
 * Recolored vomit pile
 * And any other suggestions that you can think of :) 
## How to Build
* Put Data into a zip folder and install using a mod manager
